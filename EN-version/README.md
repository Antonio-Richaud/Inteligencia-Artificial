In this little corner of the internet, I will gradually upload all the works that I find interesting and that are related to Artificial Intelligence (AI). This repository is a collection of my experiments, tests, and projects using different AI methods, including neural networks or works that I find interesting.

## Description

In this repository, you will find tests with various AI methods. My goal is to explore and experiment with different AI techniques and algorithms, share my findings, and learn in the process. Some of these works will be shown in my [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@antonio_richaud) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuKB7A8ranhDjXVH3pQ5IUA) videos, where you can see in detail how they work and how I implement them.

## Repository Content

This repository contains:

- **Neural Networks:** Experiments and projects using different types of neural networks (CNN, RNN, LSTM, etc.).
- **Machine Learning (ML):** You will find these types of works in my [Data Science](https://github.com/Antonio-Richaud/Data-Science) repository.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Projects related to text analysis, natural language generation, etc.
- **Computer Vision:** Works using computer vision techniques for image analysis and processing.
- **Other AI Methods:** Any other method or AI technique that I find interesting and decide to explore.

## How to Use This Repository

You can clone this repository to explore the projects and experiments yourself. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Antonio-Richaud/Inteligencia-Artificial.git
   
2. **Explore the projects:**
   Each folder contains a different project with its own README (some don't have it :b) explaining how it works and how you can run it.

## Contributions

Feel free to contribute to this repository. Here are some basic steps:

1. Fork the project.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/new_feature`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push your changes (`git push origin feature/new_feature`).
5. Open a Pull Request.
